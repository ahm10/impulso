Before that I was a very critical buyer of consulting services which I believe has made me a better advisor and sparring partner for my current customers. In these glorious and adventurous days of artificial intelligence this critical sense has proved particularly important. The market is so full of magic dust and unrealistic promises about what artificial intelligence may bring in terms of prosperity success and eternal customer satisfaction. Working in this landscape every day with some of the most brilliant data scientists I have ever met Im also convinced that the world as we know it is changing and artificial intelligence plays an essential role. When I listen to lectures read articles and books or just reflect on the teams work I make notes in my very analogue black Moleskine which is always tagging along in my mobile handbag office. Here are five of my most important notes:', 'Ive been in many a customer meeting where the customer wants to assess different technologies for AI. Seriously it doesnt matter. Artificial intelligence is about applying mathematics and statistics to data usually solved through the programming language Python. Its like spending hours on debating the brand of screwdrivers with your carpenter. Dont. They will choose whatever works best for their purpose given the context of the job at hand. What matters to them and even more to you is what you want your house to look like when the work is done. If you fail in expressing what you want to achieve you are very likely to be extremely unsatisfied and youll have to redo the work.', 'The terms Proof of Concept (PoC) and pilot are often used interchangeably. They do mean different things though and the outputs are potentially VERY different. A PoC is about testing a concept or a technology to verify whether it makes sense in a given context. Typically a PoC is executed on very limited prerequisites with limited data and low precision requirements and without interaction with the surrounding operational environment. Consequently the results of the proof of concept typically ends up in a drawer far away from the CFOs nose. A pilot on the other hand is a limited production scope which means you start small but still aim for a full production scope and you have to think through the operational implications from the very start. It also means that youll be encouraged to prioritize processes that are truly relevant for your core business.', 'Lets have an example: A utilities company wants to develop a machine learning model to predict downtime of windmills in order to schedule maintenance with a proactive and preventive approach. The technical manager is an experienced guy with a long track-record in maintaining heavy equipment. No matter how good the predictive maintenance model you develop is you still need to convince the technical maintenance manager that his experience and gut feeling is about to be replaced (or better complemented) by an algorithm. If he is not in on this from the beginning dont waste your money (or your time) because in his eyes the algorithm will fail no matter how useful it couldve been. Yes artificial intelligence is about algorithms but your business is ultimately about people (your employees) who again work with people (customers).', 'Ive seen this scare some leaders into decision paralysis. Dont worry just start small and always keep your eyes on your business targets. Artificial intelligence is not magic. Its hard work experience and science. All those data you have collected for years are lying around waiting to be utilized. Structured systematic work by resources that are specialists in understanding the science of data in combination with your best domain specialists. Together they will unveil new insight about your business processes. Potentially worth millions. Perhaps hundreds of millions. Ive seen it happen.', 'Do you still believe that you can spend six months on strategy revisions? And another six months concluding on the business case? Sorry those days are over and theyre not likely to come back any time soon. You still need your long-term foundation and on top of that you need to develop an agile top management approach continuously learning from customers sparring partners and expert resources in the market.

Jeff Bezos', 'Since the advent of the internet many of our digitalisation projects have achieved little more than transforming a physical collection of books on a shelf to a collection of documents in a directory. Even today much of the information used to make key decisions in any industry resides in reports articles books and electronic communiqué. Natural Language Processing is a collection of techniques used to extract actionable information from these unstructured collections. It is being used today for a variety of tasks from finance (to extract signals from news articles as input to trading algorithms) to search engine queries and machine translation.', 'A tremendous amount of resources are devoted to machine learning activities within the Exploration & Production departments of the worlds Oil & Gas companies. Progress is being made on automating key workflows and some scientific literature can even be processed efficiently enough to perform sentiment analysis. But while we spend a great deal of time discussing our metrics and methodologies data scientists still spend an inordinate amount of time on preparing the data.', 'The Norwegian National Data Repository for exploration and production data (Diskos) contains over 26 000 publicly available reports. We can quickly scan and index the content of these documents to make them easy to search but programmatically extracting further meaning is not a trivial matter. When I consider the amount of time and money that has gone into the creation of each of these reports it seems a great pity that the only reliable way to derive full value from them is for a seasoned expert with a good memory to read them and disseminate the knowledge throughout their organisation.', 'To pick just one example of the kind of value that can be extracted from a text document; consider the references to good shows found in final well reports. Last year I was lucky enough to be part of a team at the Force Machine Learning Hackathon where we programmatically extracted these good shows with depth from Final Well Reports and plotted them on an interactive map. Check out the write-up here.', 'While there is no quick fix for extracting value from unstructured text files Id like to recommend a simple step towards the structured utopia so often featured on those glossy PowerPoint slides. Enter insight engines.', 'An insight engine is conceptually similar to a data lake: it automatically crawls through the various data sources in an enterprise (internal and external) and allows users to quickly answer a complex query typically via a web interface. If you want to find a set of documents containing a specific word or phrase for example both solutions allow you to rapidly locate them based on content or associated metadata. The difference lies in the connectors enrichment and natural language search capabilities.', 'Consider what is required for the insight engine to answer a question such as: Which log files do I have for wellbores that have a bottom depth in the Tarbert formation?', 'This query relies on data sources enriched metadata and natural language specific to the oil & gas industry and would only be relevant for companies operating in the Norwegian Continental Shelf. To honour this request the insight engine needs to understand all the different potential formats of log file (both the open standards and those that reside within E&P projects/databases) what a wellbore entity is what its bottom depth is and finally reconcile this bottom depth with the lithostratigraphic formation data (which could come from a variety of sources). Finally once the structured elements hidden within the question have been assembled relevant records from a variety of different sources are presented to the user. Because of this complexity many insight engine vendors focus on a single vertical. My company (KADME) is no exception and we focus exclusively on the E&P vertical with our insight engine Whereoil.', 'This kind of enrichment can be very useful as a basis for building machine learning models that take advantage of natural language processing. We can get a number of features for free without needing to engineer them manually. Further by building our query to pull data from an API we can integrate live data into the pipeline. This keeps our models alive and relevant and gives us the option of phasing out older data that may no longer be helpful. If you have access to a platform like this in your organisation consider integrating its API into your machine learning pipeline.', 'Data wrangling may not be particularly exciting but it is very time consuming. Using an insight engine that understands your industry and comes with a robust open API can really streamline the process.

Det mange ikke er klar over er at RPA (Robotic Process Automation) alene ofte ikke er den beste løsningen de kunne ha fått.', 'Når en bruker RPA for å automatisere prosesser slipper man å tenke på integrasjon mellom IT-systemene som berøres av en prosess fordi RPA forholder seg direkte til brukergrensesnittet. Kort forklart arbeider en RPA-robot som en vanlig ansatt med i all hovedsak de samme klikkene som en fysisk medarbeider og kan åpne og lukke programmer etter behov. Dette er en stor lettelse for ledere som i mange år har måttet skrinlegge IT-prosjekter grunnet tid og kostnader. Bruker en RPA kan en relativt kompleks prosess bli ferdig automatisert på få uker. At mange ledere derfor kontakter ulike leverandører av rene RPA-løsninger er dermed ganske lett å forstå.', 'Det mange ledere derimot ikke er klar over er at det er mulig å kombinere RPA med for eksempel API-spørringer (Application Programming Interface).

Du forteller servitøren hva du ønsker å spise servitøren formidler dette videre til kokken som lager maten og til slutt kommer servitøren tilbake med maten du har bestilt. Ved hjelp av API-spørringer kan du for eksempel «snakke med» CRM-systemet ditt uten å skulle arbeide direkte på brukergrensesnittet. Dette er ofte en langt mer robust løsning fordi en da ikke må «lære opp roboten» på nytt dersom det blir endringer på brukergrensesnittet. I eksempelet med servitøren betyr dette for eksempel at du ikke trenger å skulle tenke på om kjøkkenverktøyet plutselig ligger på en annen plass enn tidligere.', 'Videre kan en også kombinere RPA med blant annet språkmotorer som kan tolke ustrukturert tekst. Nyttiggjør en seg av dette kan roboten din dermed ikke bare arbeide basert på forhåndsdefinerte regler men den har faktisk blitt en god del smartere.', 'For å ende opp med den beste løsningen er det med andre ord viktig å endre tankegangen fra at virksomheten trenger et «RPA-prosjekt» til at virksomheten trenger å få automatisert en prosess på best mulig måte uavhengig av teknologi.']",[],None,['integrasjon'],"[('https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*A6PHyhwiDbjDxmunn--3oA.jpeg', 'Image for post')]",[],"['https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=%2F_%2Fsubscribe%2Fuser%2F3e65f8a6c747&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2F3min.io%2Fgj%C3%B8r-roboter-smartere-med-enkle-grep-2143c8d44acf&source=-3e65f8a6c747-------------------------follow_byline-----------', 'https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=%2F_%2Fbookmark%2Fp%2F2143c8d44acf&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2F3min.io%2Fgj%C3%B8r-roboter-smartere-med-enkle-grep-2143c8d44acf&source=post_actions_header--------------------------bookmark_header-----------']"

Seismiske undersøkelser genererer enorme mengder data og til prosessering og analyse av disse benyttes noen av de største regneklyngene som til enhver tid er å oppdrive. Avansert modellering og simulering 3D-visualisering og automatisert geologisk tolkning har vært en del av letegeologenes- og geofysikernes verktøykasse i en årrekke. Oljedirektoratets database for seismikk og brønndata på norsk sokkel Diskos inneholder omlag 10 petabyte data og vokser raskt.', 'Hva betyr begrepet digitalisering for en bransje og et fagområde som har vært blant de ledende på bruk av digital teknologi siden hullkortenes tid?', 'Det første er erkjennelsen av at data kun kan oppnå full nytteverdi når de er enkelt tilgjengelige for bruk. En historikk for datainnsamling som strekker seg over et halvt århundre og en like lang arv av programvare for håndtering av disse har gitt et mylder av filformater databaser og lagringssystemer med dårlig innbyrdes kompatibilitet. Resultatet er at data vanskelig lar seg hente ut av ett system for å benyttes i et annet og data fra ulike fagdisipliner er tungvinte å sammenstille for analyse på tvers. I tillegg er dataene ofte dårlig strukturert og har mangelfull metainformasjon noe som gjør det vanskelig å se sammenheng mellom objekter og vurdere datakvalitet. Det jobbes derfor intensivt hos en rekke aktører i bransjen med å etablere dataplattformer som kan frigjøre data fra deres opprinnelige formater og lagringssystemer øke kontekstualiseringen og bedre tilgjengeligheten for applikasjoner. Sentrale elementer her er utvikling av robuste datamodeller og APIer for datautveksling samt standardisering av disse. Hvilken mekanisme som skal sørge for standardisering er ennå et åpent spørsmål  både konsortier kommersielle grupperinger og myndighetsinitiativ kan vise seg å definere retningen. Trolig er det den som greier å etablere nok moment til å få nettverkseffekten på sin side som stikker av med seieren. Det viktigste er uansett at bransjen evner å lande på teknisk gode standarder med størst mulig grad av åpenhet og fleksibilitet for tilpasning til spesifikke behov.', 'Videre er maskinlæring et sentralt begrep i digitalisering også for letebransjen. Maskinlæring generelt har lange tradisjoner innenfor geofagene  autotolkning av seismikk har eksempelvis eksistert i mange år  men store nevrale nettverk er relativt nytt. Prestasjonen til store nevrale nettverk bestemmes først og fremst av mengde og kvalitet av treningsdata. Det betyr at desto mer aktørene i bransjen åpner opp og deler sine data desto bedre kan verktøy basert på nevrale nettverk bli  for alle. Deling av data krever to elementer: tekniske løsninger som gode dataplattformer med åpne APIer og motivasjon til å dele hos de som eier data. På norsk sokkel har vi gode rammeverk for deling og offentliggjøring av data sammenlignet med mange andre land gjennom stabile myndighetsbestemmelser og tekniske løsninger som nevnte Diskos. Likevel er store mengder data proprietære og dermed utilgjengelige for allmenheten. Bransjen utfordres nå til å vurdere etablerte forretningsmodeller rundt eierskap til data i lys av det nye verdipotensialet som ligger i større grad av datadeling for maskinlæring.', 'Med god datatilgang i bunn er neste steg å finne fram til de verdifulle anvendelsene for maskinlæring og nevrale nettverk. Oljeindustrien støtter både offentlig og privat forskning og utvikling med betydelige midler innenfor dette området og interessen er raskt økende i takt med at spennende løsninger utvikles og kommer ut i markedet. Et hackathon sist høst sponset av en rekke oljeselskaper leverandører og Oljedirektoratet genererte prosjekter på blant annet mønstergjenkjenning på seismikk automatisk analyse av kjerneprøver fra brønner og et verktøy til å omsette håndskisser til syntetiske data. Men her har vi ennå bare skrapt i overflaten av mulighetsrommet. Bedre allmenn tilgang til relevante letedata vil kunne løfte økosystemet av utviklere og leverandører og betydelig øke tilfanget av gode ideer.', 'Begrepet digitalisering er i ferd med å konkretiseres for letebransjen og aktørene begynner å få øynene opp for mulighetene og verdipotensialet. Men for å lykkes er det ikke nok at aktørene investerer i egne prosjekter. Man må også evne å samarbeide både med partnere og konkurrenter være villig til å dele kunnskap og teknologi og til og med vurdere egen forretningsmodell og rolle i markedet.

Over the past decade theres been a tremendous push toward data-driven marketing and personalized customer experiences; a recent survey by Harris Poll indicates that most people expect consumer experiences to be tailored toward their individual tastes and preferences. At first glance a recommendation engine may seem like an elegant way for online retailers to fulfill this somewhat vague expectation. Before pursuing this type of technology one should think carefully about how it will benefit customers  it might not be the type of personalization theyre asking for.', 'The principal idea behind a recommender system is to present consumers with products and services they might be interested in with respect to what the system knows about them. Most of the time the business value of these systems is to boost sales. In that sense one could argue that personalized content is just a fancy word for effective advertising. Have you ever caught yourself thinking Gosh life sure would be sweeter if that screen space contained more relevant advertisements? I would wager that your answer is no. After decades of enduring that colorful noise often decorated with scantily clad supermodels weve grown accustomed to ignoring the automated salesman. In most cases nobody would notice the absence of an excellent recommendation engine.', 'Its important to remember that contexts differ and that personalized recommendations can be very useful. Imagine if YouTube suddenly abandoned their recommender systems in favor of simply listing content in alphabetical order. People would be outraged… or at least mildly inconvenienced. There are certain websites on the internet where recommendation engines play a crucial role in how consumers interact with content  YouTube and Netflix being prominent examples. For sites like Amazon this is arguably less true. Sure there are Amazon shoppers who enjoy browsing their personal recommendations but I think the average customer wouldnt care if Amazon replaced their recommender systems with completely random product suggestions. E-commerce websites differ in the extent that consumers actually benefit from recommendation engines. For most Amazon customers a product handpicked by the engine is just another advertisement while on YouTube the same type of system can be instrumental in deciding whether one ends up bored or entertained. The distinction between pushing content to boost revenue and actually helping customers can be difficult to pinpoint. Most of the time a recommender system ends up doing both.', 'When I read about developing recommendation engines (I work as a Data Science Consultant at Atea so Im sometimes asked to build such systems) I frequently come across the following piece of advice:', 'Dont build a recommendation engine unless your website gets a lot of traffic.', 'The rationale behind the advice is perfectly reasonable: If you dont get a lot of traffic from shoppers visiting your website your recommendation engine wont get many opportunities to create value. I dont necessarily think that this is good advice. Sure it makes sense if your goal is to turn a profit but thats not the only motivation one might have to develop a recommender system. For sites like Netflix recommendation engines are all about the user experience. The engines are valuable irrespective of how many people subscribe to their service. Traffic is still relevant because it determines how much time and resources it makes sense to invest in improving the system. Back when Netflix only had a few thousand customers a simple solution would probably be better than nothing but it wouldnt make sense to spend big money without expecting something in return. Today Netflixs recommender systems probably have a big impact on churn prevention and maintaining a competitive edge and Im sure the sizable investments theyve made toward developing their recommendation technology are paying off. From Amazons point of view their size is what makes recommender systems worth the effort even if the average shopper tends to completely ignore their recommendations. When you have hundreds of millions of customers the occasional extra sale generated through recommendations can amount to sizable figures.', 'Ive been assisting a local brewery Hansa Borg Bryggerier with developing a recommendation engine for their online sales portal. A prerequisite for accessing this portal is that you must hold a license to serve alcohol in Norway. This means that relatively few businesses are allowed to use the website and that its never going to see large amounts of traffic. If we were to follow the advice referenced above we wouldve abandoned the idea of developing a recommender system. We didnt abandon it because Hansa Borg saw great potential with respect to personalizing the customer experience.', 'The goal behind this particular system was to assist customers in the hospitality sector when they perform the regular task of ordering beverages and supplies. Using a recommender system to boost sales probably wouldnt work well in this context. Bars and restaurants are a lot less likely to make frivolous purchases compared to individuals shopping for miscellaneous products on Amazon. Taking on a new product usually entails extra work (updating menus training staff etc.) which isnt what bar and restaurant managers have on their mind when they contact Hansa Borg to restock their supplies.', 'Every recommendation engine needs some sort of key performance indicators. For Amazon this is probably clicks or purchases or both. For Hansa Borg the KPIs were how long it takes a customer to get the job done and how often they have to come back to order more stuff within the same week. Its not uncommon for their customers to place several orders within a single week usually because they forget some stuff the first time around. Our ambition was to minimize the time spent on the site and help customers find everything they need on the first attempt. These business goals presented us with the need for a somewhat unusual recommendation engine.', 'Under the hood the goal of most recommender systems is to find products similar to the stuff youve consumed in the past. The traditional recommender algorithms would not do the trick for us instead we defined our task as a time-series classification problem. This is a fairly established type of problem in the world of machine learning but I have not seen it employed within the context of product recommendations before which is why I have the audacity to claim that our recommendation engine is an unusual one.', 'Hansa Borg has a fairly good idea about what each customer is going to order in the future because their menus are quite stable over time. The main source of uncertainty is when they will need to resupply the various items on the menu. As it turns out this is a question that machine learning algorithms are well equipped to answer. After feeding historical sales data through several candidate classification algorithms we began seeing promising results fairly early in the process. The vision of a website where the first thing you see is exactly what you need was firmly within reach. As a matter of fact this feature is about to go live and Im fairly excited about it. The Hansa brand is part of the cultural identity of my home town; this is the beer my grandfather drank and Im known for consuming responsible quantities of it myself. It has been a real honor and a privilege to make my own small contribution toward their wider goal of becoming a more data-driven organization.', 'Whether or not recommender systems make sense for your website depends entirely on your context. If youre certain that it will benefit your customers I would say go for it  but be mindful of the costs. If its all about boosting sales and unlikely to actually benefit your customers then the size will be pivotal; dont bother unless youre seeing a lot of traffic. Like most things in business costs should be weighed against benefits. These days you can develop a recommender system in less than a day it doesnt have to be fancy and there are plenty of off-the-shelf solutions that will probably do the trick just fine.', 'In my opinion famous examples like Netflix and Amazon are dominating the literature on recommender systems. Most tutorials blog posts and how-to guides are geared toward tackling the problem in terms of collaborative- or content-based filtering forgetting that the concept of providing personalized recommendations is much broader. Dont abandon the idea of developing a recommender system simply because the Netflix / Amazon approach doesnt fit your context. When we break it down to the core concept its all about providing users with buttons that they want to push; there is plenty of room to be creative.

What is so special about it is that with the help of neural nets and optical character recognition it managed to transform tons of unstructured data both typed (with a typewriter  we are talking about 60 year old documents) and handwritten texts into a searchable format. By using computer vision and celebrity recognition it identified people involved in the murder and captioned their photos. It disclosed cryptonyms.

That was his best season.¹ That was 95 years ago. Mike Trout is on pace to eclipse that mark this year.', 'Im fascinated by Mike Trout. Hes so clearly the best player in baseball but because hes so understated no one talks about him much. It certainly doesnt help that his team the Los Angeles Angels of Whatever are often mediocre-to-bad.² Some people will try to argue that if he is indeed the best player he should elevate his team to be amongst the best just like LeBron James does with the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA. Those people dont understand baseball. One player even the best player even by far the best player can only elevate a team so far.', 'How far? Well theres a stat for that. Its called WAR. In his best seasons Trout has elevated his team to about 10 additional wins. This season he could push them to 14 wins that they likely wouldnt get without him  just like Babe Ruth did for the Yankees in 1923.³', 'Anyway three years ago I wrote about Babe Ruths WAR and how the stat showcased not only just how great he was  but that he was clearly the best ballplayer of all time. Its not just that his 182.5 career WAR is number one on the all-time list  its that hes a full 14.5 WAR ahead of the next closest player: Cy Young.⁴', 'Even better is this list which keeps track of the career leader in WAR every year on an ongoing basis. Cy Young topped the list for nearly 30 straight years until Babe Ruth came along and took over the top spot in 1932. Hes held that same top spot for 86 years and counting.', 'Given everything above hes likely to hold the top spot forever. Except that Trout is about to challenge Ruths best season as Buster Olney laid out last week. Of course it would take sustaining that 10+ WAR level of production over the next decade  yes a crazy thought\u200a to even get close to Ruth. If his production slips or (god forbid) if he gets injured….', 'Anyway the fact that were even having a discussion about that discussion is insane. Because Mike Trout is insane. And its insane that the mainstream doesnt recognize this more fully.', 'Of course the recognition may have to come alongside his next contract. The Angels for all their faults were ingenious with the deal they got Trout to sign in 2014. To some it seemed crazy at the time.⁵ But just a few years later it was obvious to everyone just how good of a deal it was. As The Economist pointed out in late 2016:', 'Mr. Trout is also very very underpaid. To be sure no one will shed a tear for a player who will have made $148m by age 28. But his club the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (yes for Spanish speakers The The Angels Angels of Anaheim is their full name) wisely inked him to a long-term deal in 2014 at a fraction of his true value. According to Fangraphs his free-market price would likely be more than double the $30m a year he will receive over the next four seasons.', 'Yes $60 million a year. This was followed by a call to do the unthinkable  to trade the best player in baseball:', 'The other is to face the unthinkable and  gasp!  trade Mike Trout. Players with the undisputed title of Best In Baseball™ are rarely dealt and almost never before the final year of their contracts. But the potential return for four years of Mr Trouts peak is hard to contemplate. Were he a free agent today seeking to sign a four-year deal he would probably earn about $250m or $130m more than the Angels will pay him. Based on a recent estimate of the market value of top minor-leaguers  whom MLB teams get to under-pay for up to seven seasons before they become free agents  $130m is roughly equal to the profits a team could expect to extract either from two top-ten MLB-ready youngsters or one budding superstar with five or six years of team control remaining. So lets start the bidding there.', 'The Angels of course didnt do that. But that next contract is going to have to be so large that it will almost ensure Trout will get dragged kicking and screaming into the spotlight.', 'As Michael Baumann noted on that topic for The Ringer last year:', 'Since arriving in the majors Trout has played five full seasons and hes won five Silver Slugger awards and made five All-Star teams. Hes led the American League in WAR five times and finished no worse than second in AL MVP voting including two wins. Since 1901 nobody except Williams has produced more WAR than Trout in his first six seasons though Williams played an extra 81 games and five of those seasons were pre-integration. Trout has the sixth-highest OPS+ (minimum 2500 plate appearances) for a player in his first six years though everyone ahead of him except Ty Cobb was older and played in a less valuable corner position. Trout has two 10-win seasons a feat only five players (Trout Bonds and three Hall of Famers) have ever achieved. At his current pace Trout will close in on 60 career WAR  the modern sabermetric floor for a Hall of Fame career  in early 2018 when hes 26 years old and with less than seven years of service time. Hell have Hall of Fame numbers three years before hes played long enough to be eligible for the Hall of Fame.', 'A year later Trout is slightly behind pace: he will hit 60 WAR sometime in the middle of 2018. He will also crack into the top 10 active players when it comes to WAR (he technically already has with Ichiro Suzuki effectively retiring). All but one other player on the list is over 35 (Zack Greinke turns 35 this season). Again Mike Trout is 26 years old. Its incredible.', 'Anyway just a weekend afternoon baseball statistics aside for everyone.

And while its not entirely fair (nor entirely accurate) without his 14 WAR the team still would have likely had the best record in the AL that year.', '⁴ Cy Young is just 2.8 points ahead of number three Walter Johnson  who is just 2.4 points ahead of number four the steroid-infused Barry Bonds…', '⁵ Though Ill note that I thought it was smart  talk about understatement.']","['Mr. Trout is also very, very underpaid.

While it may be easier to do some things via a screen or keyboard in many cases thats in large part because functionality to make such action more robust was built out over time. Further continuing to use such functions will simply perpetuate those paradigms.', 'I agree that for many things those inputs are the better way to do things right now  and presumably this is why Amazon is working on an Echo with a screen  but to enable the future of functionality we need to break habits. The Echo showcases this perfectly.', 'Anyway I suspect Schiller is being a bit disingenuous here. Rumors have Apple working on its own Echo-like device so this could simply be an old Steve Jobs-like maneuver of dismissing a space until you launch a competitor.

With each passing day I love these things even more. And while theyre sort of symbolically tied to music right now (thanks to the similar look to Apples iconic white EarPods which became synonymous with iTunes via all those brilliant ads) they are perhaps the perfect product yet for the vocal computing world laid out above.', 'Theyre not just good for music theyre great for audiobooks for podcasts for listening to anything via my voiceover hack. And of course they include a microphone for the other part of the equation. Yes EarPods were good for all of this too  the difference as Im coming to realize is that you can almost leave the AirPods in all day without even realizing theyre there. Theyre an extension of your body  one thats always connected to the internet via your iPhone (or iPad or Mac).⁴', 'More importantly the fact that Apple built-in the ability to trigger Siri (double-tap) almost negates my concerns about Apple in this space as mentioned above. If it were well done  meaning worked more than a fraction of the time on first attempt  it might fully negate my concerns.', 'Of course such functionality needs to be more fleshed out presumably through Siri (though not necessarily) to let a thousand apps and services flourish. And not just the obvious ones like podcasts etc. For this world to really take off were going to need a thousand new types of services.', 'Think about services that may be voice-first. Its really hard to do that right now in our current world. But theres clearly opportunity there. What if this is not just the next platform but the future of computing in general…', 'Again Amazon has the lead here. A couple nights ago my wife and I started playing Jeopardy with Alexa. It was brilliant. So seamless so obvious so much less overhead than launching a visual-based game (whether on the phone or on a video game console) so much more interactive than watching television (where Alex Trebek wont tell us specifically how we did).', 'Its a silly example.

Thats also silly  until all those children grow up and start to interact with all of their computers this way.', '¹ This is the vision of the future that everyone points to in the movie Her of course. But in that world Theodore doesnt interact with Samantha mainly on a smartphone but rather through an earpiece. The screen is the backup device for certain visual tasks…', '² Of course thats a lot easier to do when you tried to launch a phone and utterly failed.', '³ Wouldnt it be interesting if after all the wasted words about the operating system for the home it wasnt one of the living room devices like Apple TV or Xbox but rather Amazon that nailed this via Alexa?', '⁴ Yeah battery life has to be better than 5 hours to make this a true reality but as long as youre not constantly listening to music the effective battery life is much longer.', 'More thoughts:']",[],None,"['tracking of vitals', 'only', 'a billion', 'maybe¹', 'to', 'on', 'only', 'easier', 'right now', 'a fraction of the time', 'fully', 'new', 'the future of computing', 'all', 'Her', 'backup', 'tried', 'More thoughts:']","[('https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*T7_E3WruPVT9zdFKd8fAag.jpeg', 'Image for post'), ('https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/1024/1*sSE_KV6em7ewz-FbY9E_hg.gif', 'Image for post'), ('https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*MueQf-EQLY5jbcouF8EQXg.png', 'Image for post'), ('https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/1024/1*S9WCK0Vf20S8MWhCLVkFHw.gif', 'Image for post')]",['/computing-in-concert-679e68c14b8a'],"['https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=%2F_%2Fbookmark%2Fp%2F28dd9a7ef462&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2F500ish.com%2Fthe-voice-28dd9a7ef462&source=post_actions_header--------------------------bookmark_header-----------', 'https://medium.com/@mgsiegler/the-iphone-at-10-5a85ebda7cf4#.sjdofnx6v', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bob', 'https://www.google.com/search?q=bluetooth+headset+guy&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAvrDgirvRAhVpqFQKHW03A1cQ_AUICCgB&biw=1280&bih=739', 'https://backchannel.com/voice-is-the-next-big-platform-and-alexa-will-own-it-c2cf13fab911#.uojrulyhz', 'https://twitter.com/benbajarin/status/816686335515758593', 'https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/28/apple-buys-virtual-personal-assistant-startup-siri/', 'https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/28/apples-big-fall/', 'https://backchannel.com/phil-schiller-on-iphones-launch-how-it-changed-apple-and-why-it-will-keep-going-for-50-years-e4412ad2c8f5#.2hufbwd9a', 'https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/798273269065347072', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-29/amazon-said-to-plan-premium-alexa-speaker-with-large-screen', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-23/apple-said-to-step-up-plans-for-echo-style-smart-home-device-itfnod11', 'https://stratechery.com/2017/amazons-operating-system/', 'https://www.google.com/search?q=earpod+ads&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw26r9jrvRAhWhv1QKHQpaCUcQ_AUICCgB&biw=1280&bih=739#tbm=isch&q=itunes+ads', 'https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/27/the-vp-of-devils-advocacy/']"

Think of the company as an API for human intelligence. It combines AI and human intelligence to solve simple human tasks like image recognition OCR audio transcription and categorization to name a few by combining Scales own models with its human scalers who perform the tasks. Tech companies in particular are at a precipice as they incorporate large data sets into their products. Some have small manual operational tasks that are imperative for the product but havent yet built out the capabilities to handle this.

Accelerated Dynamics is working on solving this problem by creating a solution that transforms drones and other unmanned products such as boats into IoT devices that no longer require human operators.

Tensorflow hacking has also become easier with Google releasing mobile-first Tensorflow models Tensorflow Lite being offered to Android developers and Tensorflow Mobile being ready for download at GitHub.', 'Increasingly AI systems are pushed to acquire soft skills and to prove themselves in areas traditionally reserved to humans: Neural networks can be used to make art to negotiate and the hope is that eventually theyll learn some social etiquette (useful for when theyll take over your job; then they can do it nicely). Google is further trying to police free speech using AI to censor YouTube. Although it sounds like a nice goal to curb extremism we must be aware that not every dissenting opinion is dangerous and dissent in itself is one of the fundamental values of every free and democratic society. The line between censoring extremism and getting rid of free speech is extremely thin and it seems unlikely that machines will have the necessary sensitivity to do the job right.', 'Related: This site expertly pairs fonts using machine learning', 'To close on a low note Uber although not yet recovered from its adventures seems determined to go on making self-driving cars.

However it appears that market research has not yet joined this trend.', 'Is automation completely absent from market researchers toolkits? Of course not. It is however expected to save a large portion of money and time. Its automation in its simplest form: doing repetitive and easy tasks faster than humans.', 'When it comes to more explorative and qualitative work despite the progress of AI in data extraction and interpretation market researchers tend to favor offline traditional methodologies (e.g focus groups). Why is that? Are market researchers skeptical about AI despite its proven effectiveness in other fields? Perhaps. Having said that many are still waiting for clear evidence of robust and trusted insights.', 'There are several reasons that should encourage market research practitioners to embrace Artificial Intelligence.', 'Traditional approaches (e.g focus groups or online questionnaires) are biased as they rely on human memory which can be faulty or may unconsciously interpret past events. No matter how well your moderator leads interviews or how well a questionnaire is designed the information you collect will still be the result of what consumers say.', 'AI-powered market research can solve this problem. It can dive into pieces of consumers lives left online and retrace several months sometimes years of online activity. The detail of this kind of analysis can be stunning: what they did where with whom when and why.', 'AI extracts insights from what people did not what they say they did.', 'Typical consumer panels are very effective at targeting consumers with general or common needs. The moment the field narrows to specific needs and attributes however (e.g. parents going on holiday with kids in a specific region of Ireland) panels quickly show their limitations. Accomplishing work in these narrowed search fields will either be impossible or will require large amounts of additional time and budget to reach a limited number of consumers.', 'AI-powered tools have the ability to build rich profiles and to aggregate a panel of consumers almost instantaneously and with very little time or money spent on human effort.', 'Once we create the consumer target ideally we would like to know everything about the consumer experience: what they did where they visited which monuments did they see at what time in which order and why. The best moderator/questionnaire could get 70% of what happened but mostly at a surface level. Why is this?', 'It is because human memory is a faulty tool prone to leaping to conclusions missing information forgetting things etc. The consequences of this when applied to marketing research are that:', 'AI allows you to know what happened when where and with whom by precisely recreating the consumer journey thanks to geolocation visual and contextual analytics.', 'Traditional market research tools need to conduct several steps of analysis before they can deliver insights. Thus delivering real-time insights seems like a far-away dream. Some online tools such as social listening tools manage to reach real-time results but are inefficient for exploratory purposes.', 'Once set-up an AI market research tool enriches insights by continuously aggregating data. If you are operating in the travel and hospitality industry you dont have to to wait for the holiday season to be over to generate insights. Instead you will be able to follow your consumers and understand their aspirations and drives along the journey giving you the capacity to act in real time too.', 'Does this mean all traditional methodologies are obsolete? Of course not. Artificial intelligence can unlock amazing amounts of information and has a spectacular array of features and capabilities. However AI-powered market research is not the holy grail and it has its own limitations. The same thing applies to focus groups or consumer interviews.

The second of these steps  data preparation  tends to be the least understood part of AI and predictive analytics in marketing. In this next post Ill dig deeper into key considerations surrounding this process namely related to data volume and data quality. When my company introduces our predictive platform to companies two of the biggest concerns we hear are: (1) Do I have enough data? and (2) Is my data clean enough?', 'How Much Data is Needed for Machine Learning?', 'Theres a rule of thumb for how much data you need in order to be successful with a predictive model and the most important number is the amount of positive signals or good examples there are in your data set. In the case of historical customer data for lead or account scoring this would be how many total opportunities or closed/won deals you have in your CRM database.', 'Of course these positive signals exist among other negatives. Make sure your positive is defined as a relatively significant achievement in the pipeline. For example the creation of an opportunity is a meaningless milestone if it happens for every single free trial that comes in. Instead consider going further down the funnel to find a tougher hurdle that really points to lead quality.', 'Predictions will be most accurate when you have around 400 to 500 of these positive results. In that range they can be randomized and split into two proportions (60% and 40%) for model comparison. If you have fewer than a hundred examples to test your model over your results wont be quite as precise as you might want (until you add more data over time and refresh the model).', 'How AI Solves the Data Hygiene Problem', 'The truth is that no business has perfect quality complete data but thats okay. Modern data preparation techniques are built to work around that very problem so theres no need to delay AI initiatives while you wade through cumbersome data clean-up projects. If you do youll just leave revenue opportunities on the table. By matching whatever limited lead data you have with hundreds of external signals from the web predictive platforms like Infer can build a complete picture of each prospect or customer. In fact our algorithms can produce lead scores with nothing more than a company name or an email address. Thats thanks to advanced data science approaches like Natural Language Processing (NLP) which can bridge gaps in your data by looking for patterns in web crawls performing title normalization and doing spam analysis on form input.', 'Title Normalization', 'Anyone who has sold into IT or the sales and marketing industry knows that job titles are all over the place (or sometimes not included in the data at all). Title normalization techniques tend to be especially important for lead fit models because you need to know that Marketing Director might be equivalent to demand gen lead or that IBM and International Business Machines are the same company. NLP essentially splits out each word that exists across all of your records and uses an algorithm to assess related patterns and find the words that show up most often in positive outcomes for a particular data set.', 'Spam Analysis', 'Another sophisticated feature to look for is spam analysis  something thats often used in consumer search algorithms like Google. By analyzing the number of capitalized characters and key input for a name company title or email you can assess the likelihood that each data point is a legitimate input. For example the way a persons fingers traveled across the keyboard (i.e. the number of row switches etc.) often indicates whether their entry is legitimate. An email like asdf@ggg.com doesnt travel very far and is probably not a real address. Machine-learning can perform these checks on every single record regardless of whether or not it matches a known website domain.', 'As you can imagine NLP alone can help you immediately improve your data hygiene. Thats why instead of doing months of data cleansing first in hopes of being able to get better intelligence later on its smarter to get your predictive and AI initiatives started now with the data you have. Theres no sense in spending time and money augmenting fields and cleaning up data that isnt helpful for your models anyway.

Nick Bostrom', 'Thomas is a broker. On a daily basis he takes a close look at automotive bonds and until now has gathered information from different sources. Recently he decided to use a tool that includes all automotive companies with their market rate company news proportion of equities and much more.', 'The vendor of the tool explained to him that based on artificial intelligence the tool was able to make excellent and incredibly fast predictions. Thomas is curious. He opens the program and immediately finds a list of all companies and specific forecasts. On the basis of sentiment analyses the algorithm recognizes the public opinion about the company. To the sentiment analysis the algorithm adds data about the current economic situation and specific economic developments in the automotive industry.', 'Moreover it includes information on how positive and negative news impact the respective companys exchange rate. Thanks to artificial intelligence Thomas has all the information at a glance. But what does artificial intelligence actually mean? How will it impact banking in general and what role does Outbank play in this technological revolution? To answer these questions we have written the following blog post.', 'Artificial intelligence refers to the science of programming machines and computers in a way that they are able to understand and develop intelligent behavior. For this purpose developers build very specific algorithms. These machines are used for roboters apps and other things. However this technology is still at an infancy stage of its development and therefore available only in a handful of applications. Basically artificial intelligence pursues two goals: making peoples life easier and improving the understanding of human behavior. To reach this goal experts from cognitive science psychology neurology philosophy linguistics informatics and engineering are closely working together on intelligent solutions.', 'In order to develop artificial intelligence developers first define what data is analyzed and what results the analysis is expected to produce. In the case of a banking app like Outbank data searched includes sender name reference IBAN amount date and similar banking information. In the case of Outbank the result is defined as a list of tags that is supposed to get assigned to specific transactions. At the learning stage the algorithm examines the data pool and compares the information. If the data matches the tag the algorithm memorizes the combination and saves it. The more often the algorithm goes through this process the more precisely will data be assigned  and the more precisely data is assigned the more suitable tags will be suggested. Artificial intelligence is created to not only simplify banking for a specific behavior pattern but for millions of people who tag very differently and have very diverse finance flows. The only thing they have in common is that both are using the same app. The fact that artificial intelligence is able to recognize so many different patterns makes it so revolutionary and attractive.', 'As intelligent algorithms search data pools automatically developers no longer have to personally access the data analyze it and create patterns manually. This way the categorization process can be conducted on the users phone without interference of third parties. For companies like Outbank this is really essential. We neither collect nor save customer data. Still artificial intelligence enables us to provide intelligent features that make it easier to manage finances.', 'Outbank provides tags to help and simplify financial handling. While until the present day users have to manually tag every single transaction artificial intelligence optimize this process. At the learning stage the algorithm receives a set of predefined tags as a template. It will then search a data pool provided by Outbank employees and their friends and generate a tagging pattern. Afterwards this model will be integrated into the new Outbank. It will enable quick categorization by providing automated tagging suggestions.', 'On average users need 10 seconds to tag a transaction: choose the transaction tap on add tag select the right tag und confirm. Depending on how many accounts are in use the users may spend several minutes daily just categorizing. The AI techniques were working on will automate this process. This in turn will save users a lot of time they may then spend otherwise.']",['“Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make.” — Nick Bostrom'],None,None,,[],"['https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=%2F_%2Fsubscribe%2Fuser%2F8ca4774e2a6c&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Faboveintelligent.com%2Fartificial-intelligence-917b49d6c8b2&source=-8ca4774e2a6c-------------------------follow_byline-----------', 'https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=%2F_%2Fbookmark%2Fp%2F917b49d6c8b2&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Faboveintelligent.com%2Fartificial-intelligence-917b49d6c8b2&source=post_actions_header--------------------------bookmark_header-----------', 'https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1094254051?pt=59026&ct=website&mt=8', 'https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/outbank-alle-banken-und-konten/id1094255754?ls=1&mt=12', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stoegerit.outbank.android']"

These events continue to show that AI offers immense benefits to multiple industries and should be encouraged.', 'A couple days ago Katja Grace of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute and along with several other researchers published a survey of over three hundred AI experts. Grace asked the participants to estimate when AI will outperform humans in a number of different tasks. She then calculated the median response and came up with the chart below.', 'One prediction to note is the High Level of Machine Intelligence milestone pegged at forty five years from 2016. This means that the median response of the experts surveyed believed that there was a 50% chance that AI would outperform humans in basically every task by the year 2061.

That refers to the board game that AlphaGo already dominated. Ten years ahead of schedule. Once again this demonstrates that predictions about such a quickly developing technology are difficult to make.', 'Researchers at the University of California Berkeley developed a model to basically add curiosity to the learning algorithm. Their AI uses reinforcement learning to teach itself skills that are almost impossible to code. A fundamental problem with this kind of learning is that it does not work well when the necessary feedback is delayed. Pulkit Agrawal a PhD student at Berkley who worked on the project offers the example of computer games in which the benefits of certain actions are not immediately perceivable. By including this artificial curiosity Agrawal and his colleagues made the learning process more efficient. They believe that by developing these algorithms machines will be more able to solve real-world problems.', 'AI continues to be applied to more and more industries. It is now making its way into the interview room where it is especially benefiting small startups. Entrepreneurs like Jason Freedman who started an online commercial real estate business called 42Floors.com have numerous responsibilities at their fledgling businesses. When Freedmans small business began to grow he had trouble finding time to look through all of the applicants and hire new employees. He turned to another startup called Interviewed that offered him a hiring assistant in the form of an algorithm.', 'Intervieweds software uses natural-language processing and machine-learning to predict how well a potential employee will fit a companys culture and work with customers. For example the algorithm assesses how often an individual uses the words please and thank you to draw conclusions about how empathetic and personable that individual is. Using AI Freedman says We can look at 4000 candidates and within a few days whittle it down to the top 2% or 3%. Forty-eight hours later weve hired someone. Smaller startups like Freedmans can broaden the pool of applicants they consider while still cutting down on the time it takes to hire a new employee.', 'Interviewed is not the only new company looking to disrupt the $100 billion HR assessment market. A slew of startups are developing similar tools for both small businesses and corporate giants. San Francisco-based Entelo mines candidates social media profiles to predict who is more likely to move from their current job. Talent Sonar offers its customers AI that can write job descriptions aimed at improving gender diversity. The company also has software that completely anonymizes resumes so the hiring manager can review applicants with as little bias as possible. HireVue uses AI to analyze a candidates tone facial expressions and word choices and predict the best applicant for its customers companies.', 'AI is offering companies a faster cheaper and more data driven method of hiring the best candidates to fill their open roles. Since algorithms are unbiased this software can also protect companies from discrimination as well as present minorities with a greater chance of finding a well-suited job.', 'Early last month a contest aimed at automating the detection of lung cancer concluded. The winning team composed of students from Tsinghua University in China took home the $1 million prize. The team used a neural network and a two-step approach to identify potential tumors based on the tomography images. The team decided to make their algorithms available to the public to maximize the potential benefits to the medical field. And there will be significant benefits for those suffering from the 222500 new cases of lung cancer each year if these tools are developed. Using AI to catch tumors and cancer earlier than human doctors can will increase the survival rate of those with the disease.', 'Around the same time that the contest prize winners were announced a Canadian company called Deep Genomics joined the small but growing list of firms using AI to develop new pharmaceuticals. The company currently uses machine learning to discover patterns related to the causes of genetic diseases. They want to use this genetic data in order to produce drugs that can remedy those causes. Brenden Frey the companys founder estimates In five years or so the pharmaceutical companies that are going to be successful are going to have a culture of using these AI tools. Using machine learning to point drug developers in the right direction could help lower the massive cost of producing new drugs by decreasing resources spent working on unsuccessful drugs.', 'China has stepped up its interest in AI recently. After Googles AlphaGo software defeated the worlds top ranked Go player China turned even more attention to its thriving AI industry. The government pledged to spend $15 billion on the industry by 2018. The Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence called for greater access to AI and machine learning courses in universities and for higher academic status for those courses. Chinese students are flooding into AI-related courses often overflowing lecture halls. Online courses like those offered by Beijing-based ChinaHadoop have popped up to meet the growing demand.', 'Chinese professors seem hopeful that this activity will benefit humans. Minlie Huang a professor at Tsinghua University who specializes in AI believes that it is inevitable that humans and machines will complement each other. Similarly Jie Tang another professor at Tsinghua expects research on how machines and humans can effectively work together will grow. Partnerships between the academy and industry are likely to develop in order to bring the benefits of AI to consumers.', 'Artificial Intelligence continues to advance both here in the United States and abroad. Along with it come benefits to corporate behemoths small businesses patients and consumers. Despite the promise of these positives a growing number of people want regulation to control AI. My colleague Adam Thierer points out some of the problems with rushing into overly restrictive regulations. One of the most significant reasons some rush to regulate is that the benefits of AI are difficult to see for most people. Fortunately for those who try to make the case for encouraging AI and machine learning both the business world and the medical field are showing us more explicitly how this technology can enhance our world. Enacting any poorly thought out regulations could stop all of that in its tracks.']",[],"['Experts Offer AI Timeline', 'AI Gets Curious', 'AI Conducts Interviews', 'AI Goes Medicinal', 'AI Explodes in China', 'Conclusion']",None,"[('https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/0*m2G5KsVYrjDeJVZ1.jpg', 'Image for post'), ('https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*DAWGourXsxhe1LWGjilbbQ.png', 'Image for post')]",[],"['https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=%2F_%2Fsubscribe%2Fuser%2F2769dae1ce42&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Faboveintelligent.com%2Fartificial-intelligence-advances-131514e5eaad&source=-2769dae1ce42-------------------------follow_byline-----------', 'https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=%2F_%2Fbookmark%2Fp%2F131514e5eaad&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Faboveintelligent.com%2Fartificial-intelligence-advances-131514e5eaad&source=post_actions_header--------------------------bookmark_header-----------', 'https://medium.com/@jordanreimschisel/that-ai-you-hate-you-really-love-a7d600ab6079', 'https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607970/experts-predict-when-artificial-intelligence-will-exceed-human-performance/', 'https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08807', 'https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607886/curiosity-may-be-vital-for-truly-smart-ai/', 'https://www.entelo.com/', 'https://talentsonar.com/', 'https://www.hirevue.com/', 'https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604339/million-dollar-prize-hints-at-how-machine-learning-may-someday-spot-cancer/', 'https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604305/an-ai-driven-genomics-company-is-turning-to-drugs/', 'https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607972/chinas-go-masters-and-researchers-are-optimistic-about-the-countrys-ai-future/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/business/google-deepmind-alphago-go-champion-defeat.html?_r=0', 'https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607972/chinas-go-masters-and-researchers-are-optimistic-about-the-countrys-ai-future/', 'https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607972/chinas-go-masters-and-researchers-are-optimistic-about-the-countrys-ai-future/', 'https://morningconsult.com/2017/04/11/poll-majority-say-regulations-needed-artificial-intelligence/']"

Indeed areas like robotics artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things have seen some overwhelming progress.', 'But the fact that really lies at the very core of this revolution is that billions of people are now connected together by devices like cell phones which possess immense processing power and storage capacity. And that is what has made the Big Data boom possible beyond the CERN data centers (which through its Large Hadron Collider experiments collects roughly 30 pentabytes of data per year) wildest dreams.', 'In 2015 Facebook users sent an average 31.25 million messages and viewed 2.77 million videos per minute.

On a yearly basis the volume of information is growing at rates that regularly demand more and more sophisticated tools to analyze and structure it.', 'That is where approaches like deep learning come into play. The premise of deep learning is to uncover rich hierarchical models that represent probability distributions over the kinds of data encountered in artificial intelligence applications such as symbols in natural language corpora. Organizations like Findo are taking part in research that will help create models capable of understanding and then generating text data. This real understanding is but one step toward the goal of creating artificial human cognition and the overarching goals of Artificial Intelligence research.', 'With regard to this Findo is working on Natural Language Processing in personal clouds of files emails notes and contacts. It is also working on a product field of personal assistants and bots. Most of these are rule-based but their existence indicates a strong demand for such solutions.

It focuses on analyzing text data: email files and notes distributed across devices cloud storages tags and folders.', 'The creation of such an assistant isnt a roadblock as much as is the development of an unsupervised learning network that can be trained in different languages. This can be got around by studying the patterns of the ideal search example where it is found that information should be found not by exact keywords but by description. This is referred to as smart search. Findo is also working on a system that can understand patterns in personal data and organize it in folders. The idea is to let users experience a smart search or knowledge discovering experience.', 'Deep statistical models that contain many layers of latent variables and millions of parameters can be learned efficiently.

Like genetically engineering a Navi body with the mind of a remotely located human to ultimately help colonize Pandora. Or its floating mountains. Or the one thing we both remembered the most  how the Navi residents do the tail connection with their birds. That last thing was mind-boggling.

That is so true. However till recently we were still riding those bicycles while keeping them firmly in control (via programming). Metaphorically they did not have any brains of their own that could make decisions on where to go or how to avoid the obstacles. However things are going to be different soon. Now with machine learning and AI we are teaching machines to think. They would essentially have their own brains and learnings (biases). This means that like any intelligent (or human) relationship there is a chance of not being on the same page every now and then. Things can and will go wrong. At the best case there may be a quick reconciliation and course correction needed. At the worst one of those 2 brains can take over. Elon Musk believes there is a chance the latter may happen with the machines taking over (The Matrix scenario) and that will possibly mean the end of the humanity (and hence we need to settle on Mars etc).

This has many issues - we are artificially slowing down interactions with computers due to our human limitations.
