# Objective: To define schema for the keyspace impulso [finalized as on 08 Dec 2020.]

# Run script inside Grakn folder ( ensuring access grakn server and console)
# STEPS: 
# $[RELATIVE PATH OF GRAKN SERVER BASH e.g. .\]grakn server start 
# $[RELATIVE PATH OF GRAKN CONSOLE BASH e.g. .\]grakn console --keyspace [KEYSPACE NAME] --file [RELATIVE PATH TO SCHEMA]

# e.g. 
# $.\grakn console --keyspace impulso0 --file ../../build_KB/scripts/1_schema.gql
